# Overview
This is a review of Spring in Action ver5. This review mainly focuses on the Spring side of the Taco-Cloud project. It may contain the front-end (Angualr JS, so far not adding the JS code yet) code to render the web app as SPA.  It do contains the front-end (JSP) code to render the web app as classical MPA.

As Spring in Action ver5 is a little old now, the code in this project also has some modification which is different from the original source code of the book so that we don't use deprecated code.

## Special Notes
For Chapter 7, as both RestTemplate and Traverson are KTLO now. They are not popular (as well as the Spring HATEOS), so don't add any code in Ch7 in this repo (yet)
